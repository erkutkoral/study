The best use case for lambda functions, however, are for when you want these simple functionalities to be anonymously embedded within larger expressions. What that means is that the functionality is not stored in the environment, unlike a function defined with def. To understand this idea better, you will use a lambda function in the context of the map() function.\n\nRecall from the video that map() applies a function over an object, such as a list. Here, you can use lambda functions to define the function that map() will use to process the object. For example:\n\n- nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n \n- result = map(lambda a: a ** 2, nums)\nYou can see here that a lambda function, which raises a value a to the power of 2, is passed to map() alongside a list of numbers, nums. The map object that results from the call to map() is stored in result. You will now practice the use of lambda functions with map(). For this exercise, you will map the functionality of the add_bangs() function you defined in previous exercises over a list of strings.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"be0ceb53-dd60-45a6-b111-5a25c243992c"},{"source":"# Create a list of strings: spells\nspells = [\"protego\", \"accio\", \"expecto patronum\", \"legilimens\"]\n\n# Use map() to apply a lambda function over spells: shout_spells\nshout_spells = map(lambda spells: spells + '!!!', spells)\n\n# Convert shout_spells to a list: shout_spells_list\nshout_spells_list = list(shout_spells)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(shout_spells_list)","metadata":{"executionTime":37,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Create a list of strings: spells\nspells = [\"protego\", \"accio\", \"expecto patronum\", \"legilimens\"]\n\n# Use map() to apply a lambda function over spells: shout_spells\nshout_spells = map(lambda spells: spells + '!!!', spells)\n\n# Convert shout_spells to a list: shout_spells_list\nshout_spells_list = list(shout_spells)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(shout_spells_list)"},"cell_type":"code","id":"bf219b04-c483-4b6f-b938-5998d9d4ea9c","execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"['protego!!!', 'accio!!!', 'expecto patronum!!!', 'legilimens!!!']\n"}]},{"source":"### **Filter() and lambda functions**\nIn the previous exercise, you used lambda functions to anonymously embed an operation within map().

In this exercise, you will improve on your previous work with the count_entries() function in the last chapter by adding a try-except block to it. This will allow your function to provide a helpful message when the user calls your count_entries() function but provides a column name that isn't in the DataFrame.\n\nOnce again, for your convenience, pandas has been imported as pd and the 'tweets.csv' file has been imported into the DataFrame tweets_df. Parts of the code from your previous work are also provided.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d259efc6-ce94-4014-afad-3d9531544f51"},{"source":"# Define count_entries()\ndef count_entries(df, col_name='lang'):\n    \"\"\"Return a dictionary with counts of\n    occurrences as value for each key.\"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary: cols_count\n    cols_count = {}\n\n    # Add try block\n    try:\n        # Extract column from DataFrame: col\n        col = df[col_name]\n        \n        # Iterate over the column in DataFrame\n        for entry in col:\n    \n            # If entry is in cols_count, add 1\n            if entry in cols_count.keys():\n                cols_count[entry] += 1\n            # Else add the entry to cols_count, set the value to 1\n            else:\n                cols_count[entry] = 1\n    \n        # Return the cols_count dictionary\n        return cols_count\n\n    # Add except block\n    except:\n        'The DataFrame does not have a ' + col_name + ' column.'\n\n# Call count_entries(): result1\nresult1 = count_entries(tweets_df, 'lang')\n\n# Print result1\nprint(result1)","metadata":{"executionTime":42,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Define count_entries()\ndef count_entries(df, col_name='lang'):\n    \"\"\"Return a dictionary with counts of\n    occurrences as value for each key.\"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary: cols_count\n    cols_count = {}\n\n    # Add try block\n    try:\n        # Extract column from DataFrame: col\n        col = df[col_name]\n        \n        # Iterate over the column in DataFrame\n        for entry in col:\n    \n            # If entry is in cols_count, add 1\n            if entry in cols_count.keys():\n                cols_count[entry] += 1\n            # Else add the entry to cols_count, set the value to 1\n            else:\n                cols_count[entry] = 1\n    \n        # Return the cols_count dictionary\n        return cols_count\n\n    # Add except block\n    except:\n        'The DataFrame does not have a ' + col_name + ' column.'\n\n# Call count_entries(): result1\nresult1 = count_entries(tweets_df, 'lang')\n\n# Print result1\nprint(result1)"},"cell_type":"code","id":"81abd7a3-5728-41bc-ad81-cbfce4b407ce","execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"{'en': 97, 'et': 1, 'und': 2}\n"}]},{"source":"### Bringing it all together (3)\nIn the previous exercise, you built on your function count_entries() to add a try-except block.
